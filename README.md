# 🎮 mini_game – 3-Level Game in MIT App Inventor

**`mini_game`** is a mobile game developed using **MIT App Inventor** that challenges players to complete **three levels**, each increasing in difficulty. If the player beats all levels, they’re shown a **"Congratulations"** screen. If they fail at any level, they’ll see a **"Game Over"** screen—with the option to **restart from Level 1**.

This game was built as part of my learning journey in app development, focusing on screen logic, condition handling, and user experience design.
